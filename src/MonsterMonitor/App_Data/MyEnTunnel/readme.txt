MyEntunnel Description
----------------------

Note: This is a third party application and not associated with VanDyke Software or the author of PuTTY Simon
Tatham.

MyEnTunnel is a simple system tray application that establishes and maintains TCP SSH tunnels. It does this by launching Plink (PuTTY Link) in the background and then monitors the process. If the Plink process dies (e.g. connection drops, server restarts or otherwise becomes unreachable) MyEnTunnel will automatically restart Plink to reestablish the tunnels in the background. It tries to use as little CPU and system resources as possible when monitoring. 

Optionally, MyEnTunnel can actively monitor the connection by creating looped tunnels (either a looped remote/local tunnel pair or a single local tunnel to the ssh servers echo service) and periodically send pings. If too many consecutive pings are lost it will restart the connection.

Since it uses Plink, you can use utilities such as Pageant (a SSH authentication agent for PuTTY, PSCP and Plink) and PuTTYgen (a RSA and DSA key generation utility), as well as named PuTTY sessions. All of the networking and encryption is done by plink.exe; not by MyEnTunnel. 

MyEnTunnel also works with portaPuTTY (Handy for USB thumbdrives).
MyEnTunnel is compatible with Wine on *IX.

For the security-conscious: The password or passphrase DOES stay in memory and the encrypted version stored in the INI file isn't fool proof. So I STRONGLY suggest you DON'T use this with root accounts for security reasons! For regular workstation (attended) usage I recommend using Pagent and passphrases.

If you like MyEnTunnel, instead of sending donations please post about it online in your blog/website or message forum. (I always prefer word of mouth advertising =) )


Unicode Support 
---------------------

Version 3.6 now has full unicode support based off of the routines developed in the 3.5 dev branch.


Profiles
---------------------

MyEntunnel version 3.4 added profiles.  Simply specify the profile to use on the command line or shortcut to MyEntunnel.exe.

The creation and switching of profiles via the right click system tray menu.
The Popup menu is populated when clicked.  
The end user must use explorer to manage (remove) unused profiles.


Command line usage:
-------------------

Example:

  "C:\Program Files\myentunnel\myentunnel.exe" work

Note: when using key files with profiles the key filename changes to: 
  <profilename>-keyfile.ppk.

Example:

  work-keyfile.ppk


Advanced Options
----------------

These options are available by hand editing the myentunnel.ini:

Executable:
  Full path and name to replacement executable; normally: plink.exe
ExecArguments:
  For customized options; normally: -N -ssh -2
FullPathKeyfile:
  Full path and name to keyfile; normally: keyfile.ppk
BackScrollLines:
  Max number of lines for status window; normally: 200
ShowOnDoubleClick:
  Toggles window visibility when system tray icon is double clicked
FullPathLogfile:
  Copies output of Status window to the define logfile.
EchoPort:

Version History
---------------

Version 3.6.1 fixes a bug when the login fails. (MyEnTunnel would assume it was  logged in when it wasn't.)

Version 3.6.0 is a unicode rewrite of version 3.4.2.1.

GUI now supports dynamic languages.
Made some additional translations using Google Translate. 
(However, the phrasing may not be correct or even make sense in other languages. 
But hopefully it will convey the gist. And maybe a chuckle.)

Now including both 32 and 64 bit builds.

Switched to INNO setup to create a multilingual installer.
The INNO installer will automatically install the 32 or 64 bit version based on the OS.

Note:
If you're on a 64 bit system and want to make a portable install please use the 32 bit version. 
You'll need to manually extract it from the installer.
See: innounp available at http://innounp.sourceforge.net/ 

The plink monitoring routine has been placed in it's own thread.
The "Slow Poll" option has been removed as the application thread no longer blocks waiting on WaitForSingleObject to return.

Updated bundled plink.exe to version Beta 0.63.
Added GUI fields for to pass additional command line arguments to plink.

Removed NT service as it requires rewriting for Windows 7/Vista.

Added two methods of detecting dead SSH connections after taking a look at autossh for unix. (Thanks for the ideas!)
A remote and local tunnel pair to create a "looped back" connection.
Or a single tunnel to the servers Echo service. 
The Echo service method uses less resources and should be used if available on the ssh server.
The default ping time is 10 seconds. 
Three (3) pings must be missed to trigger a reconnect.
The round trip time (rtt) calculations are based on GetTickCount.
Both loopback and echo service pinging methods are on separate threads.
 
MyEnTunnel now has the RUNASADMIN flag in AppCompatFlags registry section.

The form will now minimize to the system tray instead of closing when clicking the Windows close button on the title bar.
Please use the right click menu option "Exit" to close the application.

Added popup menu on right click to the row of buttons on the bottom and main form body.
Local and Remote tunnels will ignore blanks and commented hash (#) lines.
GUI window can be resized at runtime.
Additional GUI changes, tweaks and internal clean ups.

The system tray icons have been slightly modified to help those who are color blind.
They will now be "unlocked" when red or yellow and "locked" when green.
